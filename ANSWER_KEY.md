## The "Impossible" Question (All Teams)

**Question**: "Amsterdam's canal belt has three main canals. If you add together the number of bridges in central Amsterdam, divide by the number of UNESCO World Heritage sites in the city, and then multiply by the number of letters in the Dutch word for 'tolerance'... what is the result?"

**Calculation**:
1. Bridges in Amsterdam/Centre: **1281** (widely cited number)
2. UNESCO Sites in Amsterdam: **1** (The Canal Ring itself)
3. Letters in "Tolerantie" (Dutch for tolerance): **10**

**Formula**: (1281 / 1) * 10 = **12,810**

*(Accept answers between 12,000 - 13,000 as bridge counts vary online)*
